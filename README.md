<h1>Flash-Cards-App-GUI</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project we are going to build a flash cards app to learn languages. We will start with csv file with 100 words in French and their translation to English. This program will show the front of the card with the French word, and after 3 seconds on the other side the English translation will be shown. Depending of if we know the word or not we will push the red or green botton. Pushing green the word will be excluded from the original list of words to learn, pushing red will show a new word. The list of words to learn is always getting updated and saved, this way we will be always continue with our learning at the same point we left.
